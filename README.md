# Trees

A tree is a data structure that consists of a collection of nodes. Each node contains data and a reference to one or more child nodes. The node at the top of the tree is called the root node, and the nodes below it are called the child nodes.

# Trees Operations

## Traversing a tree

There are three main ways to traverse a tree: inorder, preorder, and postorder. Inorder traversal visits the left child node, the root node, and then the right child node. Preorder traversal visits the root node, the left child node, and then the right child node. Postorder traversal visits the left child node, the right child node, and then the root node.

## Searching a tree

To search for a value in a tree, you need to specify the value you are searching for. The tree will be searched for the value, and the node containing the value will be returned if it is found.

## Inserting a node into a tree

To insert a node into a tree, you need to specify the data to be stored in the node and the parent node of the new node. The new node will be inserted as a child node of the parent node.

## Deleting a node from a tree:

To delete a node from a tree, you need to specify the node to be deleted. The node will be deleted from the tree.
